Module::Cooker

Like most of you reading this, I have used various tools such as h2xs,
Module::Starter, Module::Maker (and have examined Distribution::Cooker)
to create skeleton distributions.

And like most of you (I presume) I have found each to be lacking in some area.

Hence, Module::Cooker. It draws upon what I consider to be the best of the
aforementioned tools and adds a bit of my own. Specifically, I have strived
to make it as easy as possible to create custom skeleton templates that
meet the needs of different types of modules.

This module would have been much more difficult to design without the work
that has been done by many others on the aforementioned modules.
